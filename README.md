# Combining Semantic Web and Machine Learning for Representing and Manipulating Point Cloud Data

Combining Semantic Web and Machine Learning (SWeML) offers a powerful approach to represent, reason about, and manipulate 3D point cloud data. By integrating semantic knowledge with machine learning, we can enhance classification, segmentation, and retrieval of point cloud objects in complex scenes.
